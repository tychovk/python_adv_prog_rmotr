"That is exactly why we have created this course. We know that the most difficult things in programming are not just "coding". You want to learn how to debug your programs, you want to learn coding style from professionals, you need the tools used in the industry, etc. The list is long, and yet, none of that is taught in books.

This course will take you from 10 - 110 in your Python programming skills. It's designed for people who already have some knowledge of programming and want to take the next step into becoming better coders."
